My interest is in social interaction and the cognitive mechanisms that enable humans to flexibly coordinate and collaborate with one another, from shared deliberation in small groups to conformity with population-wide regularities like conventions and social norms. Recently, I have worked on the interaction between high-level cognitive processes like reasoning and judgments  of ownership over objects and low-level sensorimotor ones like objects affordances both in individual and in social contexts. 

I am interested to develop a common framework between the cognitive and the social sciences and I believe that game theory can provide the ideal toolbox. I am also interested in exploring how the most recent advancements in the cognitive and social sciences can support the design of the new digital infrastructures of contemporary societies.
